The csv files contain the results (MAE, RMSE) of the comparison between the proposed EBCR method and the state-of-the-art CF models. Note that the evaluation is based on a 5-fold cross validation (corresponding to the 5 splits of each dataset), the results refer to the mean of the 5 sets of values. The parameter k refers to the number of neighbours used during the prediction phase for the memory-based (KNN-based) CF approaches.
